based on Christophe GERMAIN's tutorial

Like says the title we will create a simple jsp. This one isn't
attached to Spring.
That's the same steps you have done for the previous J2EE(web application) application.
(what the f... ???? the application use the design pattern model view controller alias mvc)
and therefore.

 You must do the followings steps in src/main/web-app:
 1. Delete the index.jsp file.
 2. Create the folder which contains the view. therefore you
	will create /vues/ and inner bonjour.jsp.

Really difficult at the moment^^. Perhaps not enough?

Question 1: how can define the welcome page on my server.
in other words where can I change it^^.

Question 2: what's happen when launch Maven install?
Maven make the war(compile the source) and install it in the local repository.
which was accessible by other application.

on a real server, not on sts
for deploy it you will push the war on web-content or web-app
